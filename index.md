# How to make 3D scans in a museum gallery.

Hello and welcome to this 2 hour workshop on how to make a 3D scan of one of the Fitzwilliam Museum's objects. By the end of this workshop, you should be equipped to make a scan like this one of the Terme Boxer's head. We will be covering the basics of a technique called photogrammetry.

This workshop is part of our Industry Pump Priming award: 

Do (not) Touch: Using 3-D modelling to explore tactile interaction with museum collections and how this can affect the visitor perception and reaction to the museum’s ‘Do Not Touch’ policy
