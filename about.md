# About

This short site was built for these workshops by @portableant and is led in conjunction with Joanne Vine and Helena Rodwell. 

The workshops are part of this grant funded project:

Do (not) Touch: Using 3-D modelling to explore tactile interaction with museum collections and how this can affect the visitor perception and reaction to the museum’s ‘Do Not Touch’ policy

This project responds to the cultural heritage global challenge and will enable the Fitzwilliam Museum to: (1) trial new ways of collaborating with key actors in the heritage ecosystem; (2) create a solid evidence base and basis for partnership facilitating long-term collaborations and opening up new bidding opportunities; and (3) offer training to embed knowledge across the University and UCMs. Activity is focused on how to deter visitors from touching objects in the Museum’s collection, whilst responding positively to people’s desire to connect and engage with the objects through tactile engagement. This is a current international museum challenge and the subject of a Fitzwilliam pilot project.
